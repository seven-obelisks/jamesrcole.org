[jamesrcole.org](http://jamesrcole.org) is the online homepage of James Cole, a communications and public relations professional based in Central Illinois. 

I'm currently part of the [Illinois Council on Problem Gambling](https://icpg.org), where I help spread awareness about problem gambling and connect healthcare professionals with treatment resources.

Here, you'll find my professional [resume](/resume), [digital portfolio](/portfolio), as well as selections of my [film photography](/photography). 

## how it's built

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static site generator, and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. 

Like many of my projects, this site is designed to be as [lite](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/) and [accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#important) as possible.

More information is available on the site's [GitHub page](https://github.com/seven-obelisks/jamesrcole.org). The entirety of this site's architecture is made available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/MIT).
